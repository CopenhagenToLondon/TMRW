this repository is for my personal python package. it will be divided into the following sections. \\
DATA, used for data extraction, data transformation and data objects developed for the ease of use.\\
ANALYTICS, used to run standardized and advanced analysis related to various topics. There will be certain requirements, for which the DATA section has a handle on those.\\
FINANCE, for use with finance related topics, such as data, transformation and analysis. there will also be certain constructs entirely dedicated to such topics as options, IRB processes and the alike.\\
SIM, an old version of "GoldenDice", which has a series of stochastic processes and monte carlo simulations.\\
DASH, various dashboard visualizations or custom made plots for various purposes.
